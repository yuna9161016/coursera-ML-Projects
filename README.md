# coursera ML Projects: A Coursera-Inspired Project
This project is inspired by the lab exercises from the Coursera Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI.

This repository contains projects inspired by the labs and exercises from the [Coursera Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) by DeepLearning.AI. These projects are my interpretations, experiments, and implementations of the concepts learned during the course.

## Structure
- **Linear Regression**: Implementation and visualization of linear regression models using Python.
- **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**: Notes and code showcasing the differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

## Contents
- Python code for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Visualizations to illustrate key concepts.
- Additional experiments and personal insights.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for educational purposes only and is not an official reproduction of the course content. The labs and exercises are my interpretations and may differ from the original course material.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
